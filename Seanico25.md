### Hello Everyone!



My name is Seanico, I had an 1994 EP82 Starlet manual. At first I didn't know what a starlet was but upon digging deeping on Google I found out what it looked like and the mechanical specsifications and what modifications they can have or aome with. I was intrigued by it and I made it my mission to look and acquire one of these cars.   

In March of 2015 I got a call from one of my friends that there was a lady selling an ep82 Starlet and to give her a call immediately so I did. When I finally got ahold of her she told me she "_wasn't ready to sell it but I can still come and give it a look the following Saturday_", but in my mind I'm like, if the vehicle looks good and it runs good I'm more than likely going home with the vehicle once the owner approves. The day finally came to go see the vehicle and I was so excited that my heart was beating at 100kph just as fast as the Starlet would go with a standard 1000cc engine!!! So imagine how fast my heart was beating from excitment!!

The morning was a very slow morning. There was alot of traffic but that couldn't stop me from going to at least see this vehicle. Upon arrival I saw the car!! A nice blue with flakes shinning off the car and my first reaction was that "_I'm taking this car home and this is my car already!!"_, I got a little closer and realise it was automactic but that didn't deter me from wanting it I already knew I wanted to change the engine, make it manual and do everything to make the car I dreamt about feel totally like mine.

At the end of the time of me going to view the vehicle, I made the agreement to come back the Monday to purchase the vehicle. The lady also agreed of allowing me to purchse the vehice at a reduced price. Afte that, it was only a matter of getting it checked by a registered machanic to make sure it was all good with electricals and the engine was able to run for a few months after purchase. 

All in all I got the vehicle I really wanted and I was happy with the purchase .
